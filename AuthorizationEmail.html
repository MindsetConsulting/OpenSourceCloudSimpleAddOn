<p>The Google Sheets add-on <i>CloudSimple</i> is set to run a recurring report. 
The add-on was recently updated and it needs you to re-authorize it to run on 
your behalf.</p>

<p>The add-on's automatic functions are temporarily disabled until you
re-authorize the add-on. You can accomplish this by opening one of the spreadsheets
using the add-on and running the add-on through the menu. Alternatively, you can
click this link to approve authorization directly:</p>

<p><a href="<?= url ?>">Click here</a> to re-authorize the add-on.</p>

<p>This notification email will be sent to you at most once per day until the
add-on is re-authorized.</p>
